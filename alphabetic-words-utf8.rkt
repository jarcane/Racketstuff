; Given a File containing a newline-delineated list of English words, find the number of words

; Word -> List
; takes a Word and turns it into a list of that word's characters as 1-char strings.

;; Sample Output Report 
; Using the file "wordsEn.txt" gained from http://www-01.sil.org/linguistics/wordlists/english/
; (alpha-report "wordsEn.txt") produces the following report:
; (Alphabetic words in file: 544)
;(Longest alphabetic word in file: billowy)
;(Number of alphabetic words with exactly 6 letters: 37)
;(List of alphabetic words with exactly 6 letters: (abbess abbott abhors accent accept access accost adders afflux almost begins begirt bellow bijoux billow biopsy bloops blotty cellos chills chilly chimps chinos chintz chippy chivvy choosy choppy clotty efflux effort floors floppy flossy ghosty glossy knotty))
;(Number of alphabetic words with greater than 6 letters: 2)
;(List of alphabetic words with greater than 6 letters: (beefily billowy))
;(Number of alphabetic words with greater than 3 letters: 351)

; As we can see therefore, there are in fact 37 6-letter alphabetic words, just from this list
